What is the thread of control in a program? The thread of control refers to the sequence of execution followed by a program. In Unity, this usually means the main thread, which runs the game loop and processes updates, physics, and rendering. If a program has multiple threads, each thread has its independent sequence of execution.

What kinds of tasks do not require any kind of synchronization? Tasks that do not share resources or interact with each other in a way that could cause race conditions do not require synchronization. Examples include independent calculations, rendering operations on separate objects, and tasks that only read (but do not modify) shared data.
