# Game Programming Projects (Unity)

This repository contains coursework and projects developed using **Unity and C#** for **CSC 329 – Introduction to Game Programming**.  
The work focuses on core game programming concepts such as player control, collision handling, procedural content generation, and game state management.

Rather than storing full Unity build artifacts, this repository highlights **source code, design decisions, and gameplay demonstrations** to clearly showcase technical understanding and implementation.

## Featured Projects

### 🐸 Lily Pad Lane
A Frogger-inspired 2D game where the player navigates dynamic lanes of obstacles and platforms.

**Concepts demonstrated:**
- Grid-based movement
- Dynamic row and obstacle generation
- Collision handling with hazards and platforms
- Difficulty scaling over time

**Original Artwork:**
All visual assets in Lily Pad Lane were created entirely by me using pixel art tools and Procreate. This includes character sprites, environmental tiles, and UI elements.

This project combines original visual design with custom gameplay systems implemented in Unity using C#.

### 🎮 Flappy Bird Clone
A 2D arcade-style game built in Unity that recreates the core Flappy Bird mechanics.

**Concepts demonstrated:**
- Player input handling and physics-based movement
- Procedural obstacle spawning
- Collision detection and scoring
- Game state management
